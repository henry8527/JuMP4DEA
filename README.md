# JuMP4DEA

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/henry8527/JuMP4DEA.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/henry8527/JuMP4DEA)


**JuMP4DEA.jl** is a package for solving large-scale data envelopment analysis (DEA) problems. Benefited from the development of JuMP, a modeling language in Julia, and cutting-edge solvers, JuMP4DEA is user-friendly, flexible and computationally efficient to solve different DEA problems, including radial, non-radial and different returns to scale assumptions.  

##Installation
